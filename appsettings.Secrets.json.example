## appsettings.Secrets.json - LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY

This file contains sensitive information (API keys) and should NEVER be committed to Git.

It is automatically added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.

### How to Use:

1. Copy the example below and save as `appsettings.Secrets.json` in the project root:

```json
{
  "OpenAI": {
    "ApiKey": "sk-your-actual-api-key-here"
  }
}
```

2. Replace `sk-your-actual-api-key-here` with your real OpenAI API key from:
   https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

3. The application will automatically load this file at startup

### For Production:

Instead of using this file, set the environment variable:
```
OPENAI__APIKEY=sk-your-production-key
```

Or in your deployment platform (AWS, Azure, Heroku, etc.), use their secrets management system.

### Security Best Practices:

- ✅ DO: Use environment variables in production
- ✅ DO: Keep `.gitignore` updated with sensitive files
- ✅ DO: Rotate API keys regularly
- ❌ DON'T: Commit `appsettings.Secrets.json` to Git
- ❌ DON'T: Share API keys in chat or forums
- ❌ DON'T: Hardcode keys in source code
